## Introduction

In this repository, I store my solutions to various Data Structures and Algorithms problems. My goal is to systematically progress from basic to advanced problems, while mastering fundamental concepts along the way.

## Folder Structure

The repository follows a structured format to organize problems based on categories and concepts. Here's an overview of the folder structure:
```
/problems
    /basics
    /arrays
    /linked-lists
    /stacks-and-queues
    /trees-and-graphs
    /sorting-and-searching
    /dynamic-programming
    /recursion
    /hash-tables
    /greedy-algorithms
    /backtracking
    /bit-manipulation
    /string-manipulation
```

## Problem Categories

1. **Arrays**: Problems involving arrays and related operations.
2. **Linked Lists**: Problems focused on linked list data structure.
3. **Stacks and Queues**: Problems based on stack and queue implementations.
4. **Trees and Graphs**: Problems concerning tree and graph data structures and algorithms.
5. **Sorting and Searching**: Problems related to sorting and searching algorithms.
6. **Dynamic Programming**: Problems that can be solved using dynamic programming techniques.
7. **Recursion**: Problems that can be solved using recursion.
8. **Hash Tables**: Problems involving hash tables and related concepts.
9. **Greedy Algorithms**: Problems where greedy algorithms are applicable.
10. **Backtracking**: Problems that can be solved using backtracking.
11. **Bit Manipulation**: Problems involving bit manipulation operations.
12. **String Manipulation**: Problems focused on string manipulation and algorithms.

Each category folder contains subfolders for different problem-solving platforms (e.g., LeetCode, HackerRank, Codeforces) or specific problem sets.
